## What is DVWA?

Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MariaDB web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.

The aim of DVWA is to practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities, with various levels of difficulty, with a simple straightforward interface. Please note, there are both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.

## Why I did this

I completed DVWA as part of my cybersecurity learning journey, mainly to improve my web penetration testing skills.  
I wanted hands-on experience instead of just watching tutorials or reading theory.

Writing these mini write-ups helps me:
- solidify what I learned  
- document my progress  

## What I learned

- How common web vulnerabilities actually work behind the scenes  
- How small coding mistakes can lead to serious security issues  
- Basic exploitation techniques and payloads  
- How to think more like an attacker when testing applications  

It also helped me get more comfortable with tools like Burp Suite and browser dev tools.

## Things I found interesting and want to dive deeper into

While doing DVWA, I found these especially interesting and worth exploring more:

- Cryptography (hashing, encoding, weak implementations)
- API pentesting
- Authentication & session handling
